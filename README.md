# Pong
I decided to make a game to show my Java skills, and decided to do Pong a single player pratice version of pong (bouncing off of a pratice wall). 
While Pong is overdone, I thought it would be a simple game to make as my first. 
This game utilizes the LibGDX game library.

Below is the UMD diagram
